/*
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of
n (the number of variable-length arrays) and q (the number of queries).
Each line i of n the subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 â€¦ a[i]k-1 describing the k-element array located at a[i].
Each of the q subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of i (an index in array ) and j (an index in the array referenced by a[i]) for a query.

Output :
For each pair of i and j values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located at index j of the array referenced by a[i]. There should be a total of q lines of output.
